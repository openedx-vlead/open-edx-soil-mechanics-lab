<p>Soils having particle larger than 0.075mm size are termed as coarse grained soils. In these soils more than 50% of the total material by mass is larger 75 micron. Coarse grained soil may have boulder, cobble, gravel and sand.<br />The following particle classification names are given depending on the size of the particle:</p>
<p>i. BOULDER: particle size is more than 300mm.<br />ii. COBBLE: particle size in range 80mm to 300mm.<br />iii. GRAVE (G): particle size in range 4.75mm to 80mm.<br />a. Coarse Gravel: 20 to 80mm.<br />b. Fine Gravel: 4.75mm to 20mm.<br />iv. SAND (S): particle size in range 0.075mm to 4.75mm.<br />a. Coarse sand: 2.0mm to 4.75mm&nbsp;<br />b. Medium Sand: 0.075mm to 0.425mm.&nbsp;<br />c. Fine Sand: 0.075mm to o.425mm.</p>
