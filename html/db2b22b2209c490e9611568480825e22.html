<p>Procedure for the experiment is as follows.</p>
<p>1. Clean and dry the density bottle<br /> a. wash the bottle with water and allow it to drain.<br />b. Wash it with alcohol and drain it to remove water.<br />c. Wash it with ether, to remove alcohol and drain ether.<br /><br />2. Weigh the empty bottle with stopper (W1)&nbsp;<br />3. Take about 10 to 20 gm of oven soil sample which is cooled in a desiccator. Transfer it to the bottle. Find the weight of the bottle and soil (W2).&nbsp;<br />4. Put 10ml of distilled water in the bottle to allow the soil to soak completely. Leave it for about 2 hours.&nbsp;<br />5. Again fill the bottle completely with distilled water put the stopper and keep the bottle&nbsp;under constant temperature water baths (Tx⁰ ).<br />6. Take the bottle outside and wipe it clean and dry note. Now determine the weight of the bottle and the contents&nbsp;(W3).<br />7. Now empty the bottle and thoroughly clean it. Fill the bottle with only distilled water and weigh it. Let it be W4 at temperature (Tx⁰c).&nbsp;<br />8. Repeat the same process for 2 to 3 times, to take the average reading of it.&nbsp;</p>
