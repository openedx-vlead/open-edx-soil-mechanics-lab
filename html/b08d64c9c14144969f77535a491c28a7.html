<p>Field density is defined as weight of unit volume of soil present in site. That is r=W/V</p>
<p>Where, r= Density of soil<br />W=Total weight of soil<br />V=Total volume of soil<br />The soil weight consists of three phase system that is solids, water and air. The voids may be filled up with both water and air, or only with air, or only with water. Consequently the soil may be dry, saturated or partially saturated.</p>
<p>In soils, mass of air is considered to be negligible, and therefore the saturated density is maximum, dry density is minimum and wet density is in between the two.</p>
