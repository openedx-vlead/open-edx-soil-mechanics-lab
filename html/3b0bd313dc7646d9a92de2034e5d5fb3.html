<p>Procedure for the experiment is as follows.</p>
<p><strong>a) Preparation of remoulded soil specimen:</strong><br />i. Weight the required quantity of oven dried soil sample. Evenly sprinkle the calculated quantity of water corresponding to the OMC. Mix the soil sample thoroughly.<br />ii. Clean the mould and apply a small portion of grease inside the mould and around the porous stones in the base plate. Weight the mould and attach the collar to it. Fix the mould on the compaction base plate. Keep the apparatus on solid base.<br />iii. The soil sample is placed inside the mould, and is compacted by the standard Proctor compaction tools, to achieve a dry density equal to the pre-determine3d MDD. Weight the mould along with the compacted soil.<br />iv. Saturate the porous stones. Place the filter papers on both ends of the soil specimen in the mould. Attach the mould with the drainage base and cap having saturated porous stones.</p>
<p><strong>b) Saturation of soil specimen:</strong><br />i. Connect the water reservoir to the outlet at the bottom of the mould and allow the water to flow in the soil. Wait till the water has been able to travel up and saturate the sample. Allow about 1 cm depth of free water to collect on the top of the sample.<br />ii. Fill the remaining portion of cylinder with de-aired water without disturbing the surface of soil.<br />iii. Fix the cover plate over the collar and tighten the nuts in the rods.</p>
<p><strong>c) Constant head test:</strong><br />i. Place the mould assembly in the bottom tank and fill the bottom tank with water up to the outlet.<br />ii. Connect the outlet tube with constant head tank to the inlet nozzle of the permeameter, after removing the air in flexible rubber tubing connecting the tube.<br />iii. Adjust the hydraulic head by either adjusting the relative hight of the permeameter mould and constant head tank or by rising or lowering the air intake tube with in the head tank.<br />iv. Start the stop watch and at the same time put a bucket under the outlet of the bottom tank, run the test for same convenient time interval and measure.<br />v. Repeat the test twice more, under the same head and for the same time interval.</p>
<p><strong>d) Variable head permeability test method:</strong><br />i. Disconnect the water reservoir from the outlet at the bottom and connect the stand pipe to the inlet at the top plate.<br />ii. Fill the stand pipe with water. Open the stop cock at the top and allow water to flow out so that all the air in the cylinder is removed.<br />iii. Fix the height h1 and h2 on the stand pipe from the centre of the outlet such that (h1 &ndash; h2) is about 30 cm to 40 cm.<br />iv. When all the air has escaped, close the stop clock and allow the water from the pipe to flow through the soil and establish a steady flow.<br />v. Record the time interval, t, for the head to drop from h1 to h2.<br />vi. Take about five such observations by changing the values of h1 and h2.<br />vii. Measure the temperature of water.</p>
