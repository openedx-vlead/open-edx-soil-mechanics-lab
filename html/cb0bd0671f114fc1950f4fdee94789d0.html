<p>Procedure for the experiment is as follows.</p>
<p>i. Weight accurately about 200gms of oven dried soil sample. If the soil has a large fraction greater than 4.75mm size, then greater quantity of soil, that is, about 5.0 Kg should be taken. For soil containing some particle greater than 4.75 mm size, the weight of the soil sample for grain size analysis should be taken as 0.5 Kg to 1.0 Kg.<br />ii. Clean the sieves and pan with brush and weigh them upto 0.1 gm accuracy. Arrange the sieves in the order as shown in Table. The first set shall consist of sieves of size 300 mm, 80mm, 40mm, 20mm, 10mm, and 4.75 mm. While the second set shall consist of sieves of sizes 2mm, 850 micron, 425 micron, 150 micron, and 75 micron.<br />iii. Keep the required quantity of soil sample on the top sieve and shake it with mechanical sieve shaker for about 5 to 10 minutes. Care should be taken to tightly fit the lid cover on the top sieve.<br />iv. After shaking the soil on the sieve shaker, weigh the soil retained on each sieve. The sum of the retained soil must tally with the original weight of soil taken.</p>
