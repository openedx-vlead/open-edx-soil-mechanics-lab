<p>Procedure for the experiment is as follows.</p>
<p>i. Clean the containers with lid dry it and weigh it (W1).&nbsp;" Make sure you do this after you have tarred the balance"<br />ii. Take a specimen of the sample in the container and weigh with lid (W2).&nbsp;<br />iii. Keep the container in the oven with lid removed. Dry the specimen to constant weight maintaining the temperature between 105 ⁰c to 110 ⁰c for a period varying with the type of soil but usually 16 to 24 hours.&nbsp;<br />iv. Record the final constant weight (W3) of the container with dried soil sample. Peat and other organic soils are to be dried at lower temperature (say 60 ⁰c ) possibly for a longer period.</p>
